Design Spec:

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


Description of the "second, independent tidy data set":
Variables:

Stance and subject are mine, taken from the parts of data provided originially. All other variables
are the average result of the variables under the Stance in column 1 and for the subject designated in column 2.
Exact process given by "run_analysis.R".

The Data:
180 Entries, each entry is a combination of a subject and stance and the average value of the measurements taken over
their repetitions of the experiment.
There are 30 subjects, 6 stances. Therefore 180 entries.
